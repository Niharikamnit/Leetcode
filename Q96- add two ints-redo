We get sum of two integers without adding carry by using XOR
to get carry, we have to and the two ints and then add it to sum
we left shift add so that we get the carry bit to add to the i+1th bit of sum
we use unsigned toallow -ve ints

    int getSum(int a, int b) {
        while(b!=0) {
            unsigned int temp= (a&b);
            a=a^b;
            b=(int)(temp<<1);
        }
        return a;
    }
